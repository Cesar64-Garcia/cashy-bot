- title: Stop A Bad Habit that is not necessary, i.e No More Smoking!
  body: No, it's certainly not easy to quit, but if you smoke a pack and a half every day, that amounts to nearly $3,000 a year you can realize in savings if you quit.
- title: Utility Savings
  body: Lowering the AC in your home by 2-3°C can save you between 3-5 percent in energy costs.
- title: Pack Your Lunch
  body: An obvious money-saving tip is finding everyday savings. If buying lunch at work costs 100NTD, but bringing lunch from home costs only 40NTD, then over the course of a year, you can create a 21900NTD fund for emergency, sunk fund or even retirement!
- title: Analyze Your Spending
  body: Do you pay 20NTD a week for snacks at the vending machine at your office? That's 1,000NTD you're removing from your budget for soda and snacks each year. Suddenly, that habit adds up to a substantial sum.
- title: Cut down on your grocery budget
  body: It's so easy to walk through those aisles, grabbing a bag of Oreos here and a few bags of chips there, and then top it off with the fun goodies at the register. But those little purchases (aka budget busters) add up quite a bit and end up blowing the budget every single month. Be aware on your own spending!
- title: Make a buying list and let's stuck with it!
  body: Taking a good look at what you already have in your pantry before you head to the store. Because why would you want to buy more of what you already have?
- title: Cancel automatic subscriptions and memberships
  body: Chances are, you're paying for multiple subscriptions like Netflix, Hulu, Spotify, gym memberships, trendy subscription boxes and Amazon Prime. It's time to cancel any subscriptions you don't use on the regular. And make sure that you turn off auto-renew when you make a purchase. If you cancel it and decide you can't go without it, subscribe again—but only if it fits into your new and improved budget.
- title: Buy generic
  body: Hands down, one of the easiest ways to save money is to give name brands the boot. In most cases, the only thing that's better about brand-name products is the marketing. I mean, look at that box! The logo is so fancy! And that's about where it ends. Generic brands of medicine, staple food items (like rice and beans), cleaning supplies and paper products cost far less than their marked-up brand-name friends—and they work just as well too.
- title: Save money automatically
  body: Did you know that you can save money without thinking about it? Yup—you can set up your bank account to automatically transfer funds from your checking account into a savings account every month. If that sounds scary to you, you can also set up your direct deposit to automatically transfer 10% of each paycheck into your savings account. Boom!
- title: Spend extra or unexpected income wisely
  body: When you get a nice work bonus (way to go!), inheritance or tax refund (or random stimulus!), put it to good use. And when we say “good use,” we aren't talking about adding that fancy new stamp to your stamp collection or even just putting it in the bank to camp out. If you're debt-free, use those extra dollars to build up your emergency fund—you know, for emergencies.
- title: Try a spending freeze
  body: Don't buy any nonessential items for a week—or even a month! Think about it as a contentment challenge. Make your spending freeze work by prepping meals with the food you already have, avoiding stores where you tend to impulse buy (did someone say Target dollar spot?), and saying no to anything that isn't a basic necessity.
- title: Skip the coffee shop
  body: Ouch. This one is painful—we get it! But instead of spending 50NTD on that daily latte, you can save money by just making your coffee at home.
- title: Use cash back apps and coupons
  body: Nothing beats a good, old-fashioned 20% off coupon when you're buying something. But did you know there are plenty of cash back apps out there to help your savings go even further? Try LINE Coupon!
- title: Use the 24-Hour Rule
  body: Avoid purchasing expensive or unnecessary items on impulse with a self-imposed 24-hour rule. For any non-essential item, wait 24 hours before purchasing. It's perfect for online shopping where your items can simply be added to your cart to purchase later.
- title: Treat yourself, but use it as an opportunity to save.
  body: Match the cost of your nonessential indulgences in savings. So, for example, if you splurge on a smoothie while out running errands, put the same amount into your savings account.
- title: Place a reminder on our bot
  body: Remind yourself to think through every purchase by covering your card with a savings prompt such as, "Have you met your savings goal for the month?" Let's remind you that!
- title: Pay your bills on auto-pay
  body: This ensures they are paid on time, in full to avoid late charges. As a bonus, some loan providers offer a small interest rate deduction if you enroll in auto-pay.
- title: Browse online for free or low-cost local entertainment
  body: Check out local events on Facebook or Instagram to plan some downtime intead of expensive traveling. There are often events and activities listed that you probably aren't aware are happening.
- title: Plan gift-giving well in advance
  body: To go alongside spending limits, give yourself time! You'll ensure that you're giving the most thoughtful gifts, which usually end up being not as expensive. Besides, it will also give you the opportunity to look for sales.
- title: Don't buy cheap clothes for cheap's sake
  body: There are times where it makes most sense to prioritize quality over price when purchasing clothes for the family. An inexpensive shirt or coat is a poor bargain if it wears out in less than a year
- title: Designate one day a week a "no spend day."
  body: Reserve one night a week for free family and friends fun. Cook at home, and plan out free activities such as game night, watching a movie, or going to the park.
- title: Commit to eating out one fewer time each month
  body: Save money without sacrificing your lifestyle. Take small steps to reduce your dining budget. Start off with reducing the amount you eat out by just once per month.
- title: I'll take a water, thank you.
  body: It's standard in the restaurant industry to mark up the cost of alcohol by three to five times. An easy way to cut down on your restaurant spending without changing your habits too drastically is to skip the beverages, alcoholic and non-alcoholic.
- title: Turn off notifications that want you to spend money
  body: Your smartphone can be a powerful tool in helping you save, yet it can also be a big source of temptation to spend. Promotional emails and app notifications — including those announcing big deals — can persuade you to buy a product you might otherwise have skipped. Consider unsubscribing from those lists and disabling notifications.
- title: Create a 50/30/20 budget
  body: One smart way to manage your money — and hopefully hold on to more of it — is to follow a budget, which means setting priorities for your spending. This approach means devoting 50% of your after-tax income to necessities, 30% to wants and 20% to savings and any debt payments.
- title: Using the 30-day rule
  body: With the 30-day savings rule, the goal is to avoid making impulsive purchases. Instead of swiping your card, wait 30 days to see if it's worth purchasing and put the money it would cost in your savings account instead. Write down the information surrounding the item like its name, service and the cost. Use the 30 days to consider if it's a true need or just a want.
